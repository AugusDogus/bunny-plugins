# Bunny Plugins Template
This repo contains a template for creating [Bunny](https://github.com/pyoncord/Bunny) plugins.

# Installing
TBD

# Building
To build the plugin(s), perform `pnpm install` followed by `pnpm build`. Your repository will be ready in the `dist` directory. For development, you may want to pass the `--dev` option during building so Bunny prioritize your repository while loading plugins.
